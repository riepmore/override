In this level, we have a CLI asking us to read or store number into a "storage".

If we want to store something, he ask us for a number to store and then the index.
If the index is a multiple of 3, he will not store it and say:
 *** ERROR! ***
   This index is reserved for wil!
 *** ERROR! ***
 Failed to do store command

But, the stdin is read by scanf who interpret it as an unsigned int, so we can use this to write at these indexes.
With this, we can also navigate throught the stack and change the EIP of the main, but this program delete the ENV
at the beginning so we can't use it to store our shellcode.

So, we have to store our shellcode in the stack with the "store" command, and in the right order by bypassing the 
"multiple of 3" security.

And then, when the shellcode is stored, we have to overwrite the EIP to our shellcode.
GDB will give us the EIP, but for the address of the shellcode in the table, we can show it directly and the CLI
by finding the right offset with GDB. this offset is -9.
(We could also use a nop sled but it will be complicated because of the mulitple of 3 limit).
