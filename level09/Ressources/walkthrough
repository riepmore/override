This binary named l33t-m$n ask us to enter an username and to send a essage to @Unix-Dude.
So we imagined that there's a network issue or something, but no. The message is juste copied on a var that's all.

After looking to the binary, we saw that set_username() have an issue. He copy 41 chars on an array that contain only 40.
So, the last char will overwrite the variable used for the length of the strncpy in set_msg().

With that, we can overflow the msg and then, overwrite the EIP to the function secret_backdoor() who call a system().
