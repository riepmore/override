The bin ask us for a password with scanf().
In the binary, we saw that he substract 0xleetdood with our password, and if the
value is between 0 and 21, he will enter in the decrypt() function with the result
(0 to 21), and if the result is different. he will enter in decrypt() with rand()

In the decrypt function, we have this string: "Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3".
he will loop on it and do a XOR on every character with our password.
if the result is "Congratulations!", it will execute a shell.

So, for that, we need to enter this password: 322424827
Its simply, 0xleetdood + 12 in decimal.
